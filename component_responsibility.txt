# Component Responsibility Documentation

## 1. Presentation Layer
Handles all user-facing interactions. Includes:
- Admin UI: Interface for administrators to manage tracks, view reports, and configure system settings.
- Parents UI: Allows parents to view student tracking details, attendance, and performance metrics.
- Student UI: Enables students to view their own progress, schedules, and receive notifications.

## 2. Business Logic Layer
Processes inputs from the presentation layer and applies core application rules. Responsibilities include:
- Validating user input
- Coordinating data between the UI and data storage
- Applying business rules (e.g., alerts on student behavior, performance tracking logic)

## 3. Data Access Layer (Assumed)
Even though not explicitly shown, a typical layered architecture would include this layer:
- Responsible for retrieving and storing data in the backend
- Acts as a middleware between Business Logic and the database
