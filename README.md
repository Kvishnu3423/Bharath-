### Overview
This repository contains the complete architectural analysis and documentation for the Smart Track Management System, developed as part of a graduate-level software architecture exercise. The project follows a layered architecture model and focuses on a modular, scalable, and maintainable design for a real-time tracking platform.

### Learning Objectives
Apply layered architecture principles to a complex tracking system

Document cross-cutting concerns and layer responsibilities

Evaluate architectural decisions based on quality attributes

Communicate designs through standardized UMLet diagrams

Analyze interfaces and dependencies between all layers

Architectural Roles and Responsibilities
Each team member assumed one or more of the following specialized roles:

 ### 1. Presentation Layer Specialist
Defined all UI components and front-end structure

Modeled user interactions and UX flows

Specified validations and responsive behavior

### 2. Business Logic Layer Specialist
Modeled core domain logic (e.g., tracking workflows, rule engines)

Defined service interfaces and business use cases

Integrated domain-driven patterns for maintainability

 ### 3. Data Access Layer Specialist
Designed data schema and ORM strategies

Modeled storage, caching, and indexing logic

Optimized read/write queries for performance

### 4. Infrastructure Layer Specialist
Documented deployment strategies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)

Designed security, logging, and alerting frameworks

Defined scaling and fault-tolerant architecture

### 5.  Integration Layer Specialist
Modeled external API and system integrations

Documented async/sync flows and message transformation

Designed gateway and adapter interfaces

### 6.  Quality Attributes Specialist (if applicable)
Evaluated architecture on performance, security, and availability

Assessed extensibility and maintainability of all layers

Designed for reliability and monitored technical debt risks

### Interfaces and Integration
Layer-to-layer interface contracts are defined in interfaces/layer-interface-specifications.md. This includes:

API endpoints

Data formats (e.g., JSON, XML schemas)

Service-to-service authentication

Event/message handling

### Quality Attribute Analysis
Only for 6-member teams

Includes evaluations on:

Performance and scalability

Security and compliance

Maintainability and extensibility

Availability and reliability

Trade-offs between attributes
